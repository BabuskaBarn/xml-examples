# xml-examples
This repo extends the eclipse demo-project "XMLExamples" with some examples that I develop during the lecture and lab of my course "Datamanagement with XML" held at FH Vorarlberg.

## Requirements
This repo contains a project for the Eclpise IDE, hence, you will need a running Eclipse installation. I strongly recomment a recent "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers", which you can download here: http://www.eclipse.org/ide/ by following the link "Java EE".

In order to download this project, or better "git clone" this project, I strongly recomment a local installation of the git command line tools on your development machine.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo into a directory outside the workspace of your eclise installation.
1. Import the project into eclipse.
